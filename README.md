Description:

Vooby stands for "Voting Noobies" and is a stand alone NodeJS script which allows anyone to automate upvoting all post in the "#introduceyourself" (or any other) tag. I created it over the past few hours after deciding it would be neat to experiment with upvoting new users to see if it increases user retention.. and also to reward new comers to our network with their first little bit of post payout!
